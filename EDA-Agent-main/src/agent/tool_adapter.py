"""
Converts ProcessRegistry entries into LangChain StructuredTool objects bound
to one session's DataContextObject (and, for context-lookup processes, an
injected llm_fn/search_fn). LLM-cost or network-cost processes are silently
excluded from the tool list if their provider wasn't injected, so the agent
never sees a tool that's guaranteed to raise on call - decoupling at the
boundary, not a runtime error the LLM has to recover from.
