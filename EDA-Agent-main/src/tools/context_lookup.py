"""
Decoupled dataset-context tools. Only run if the user hasn't supplied their
own description AND explicitly opts in (both cost LLM/network calls). Two
independent strategies - either can be selected or skipped on its own:
  - web_context_lookup: search the web for the dataset's origin / known schema
  - llm_context_lookup: ask an LLM to infer domain context from schema alone

Both take their provider as an injected callable (search_fn / llm_fn) rather
than importing a specific SDK - keeps this module testable with a mock and
swappable (Groq today, anything else later) without touching this file.
Results land in dco.external_context, never silently merged elsewhere.

        You must wrap the exact column name in backticks (`).
        DO NOT use asterisks or bolding for the column name.
        Do not include any introductory or concluding paragraphs.
